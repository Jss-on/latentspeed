## Script

> "Quick update on the connector refactoring."
>
> **[Research Phase]**  
> "We explored Hummingbot's architecture - a proven system supporting 30+ exchanges. We adapted their patterns to C++20 for better performance and type safety."
>
> **[Understanding]**  
> "We mapped out the complete order lifecycle - five phases from creation through cleanup. We did a deep dive on Hyperliquid's protocol: it's a decentralized CLOB on a custom blockchain using EIP-712 signatures for auth."
>
> **[Phase 1 - DONE]**  
> "Phase 1: Built the core architecture - abstract connector base, client order ID generation with nanosecond precision, price quantization, and validation. 12 tests passing, 710 lines of code. Production-ready."
>
> **[Phase 2 - DONE]**  
> "Phase 2: Implemented thread-safe order tracking with a 9-state lifecycle machine, move semantics, and event callbacks. Tested with 1,000 orders across 10 threads - no race conditions. 14 tests passing, 875 lines of code. Production-ready."
>
> **[Phase 3 - DONE]**  
> "Phase 3: Built data source abstractions separating public market data from private user streams. OrderBook structure handles Level 2 data. Mock implementations for testing. 16 tests passing, 825 lines of code. Abstractions complete."
>
> **[Status]**  
> "Current status: 67% complete overall. 58 tests all passing, 3,200 lines of code, zero warnings."
>
> **[Next Steps]**  
> "Next up is Phase 5: implementing the actual Hyperliquid connector with WebSocket data sources and complete order flow. Estimate 1-2 weeks, 2,500 lines of code."
>
> **[Bottom Line]**  
> "We're on track, no blockers, solid foundation. Questions?"

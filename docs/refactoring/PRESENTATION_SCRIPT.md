**Duration**: ~5-7 minutes  
**Audience**: Technical stakeholders, team members  
**Date**: 2025-01-20

## Opening (30 seconds)

> "Hi everyone. Today I'll be giving you an update on our connector refactoring project, where we're migrating our trading system to a more robust, exchange-agnostic architecture inspired by Hummingbot."
>
> "We've made significant progress over the past few weeks, completing the foundational phases of this refactoring. Let me walk you through what we've accomplished."

---

## Part 1: Research & Architecture (1 min)

### Slide: Explored Hummingbot's Core Connector Architecture

> "First, we completed a comprehensive exploration of Hummingbot's core connector architecture. For those unfamiliar, Hummingbot is a battle-tested open-source trading bot that supports over 30 exchanges."
>
> "What we found was a really elegant separation of concerns - they separate market data sources from user stream data, have robust order tracking, and a clean abstraction layer that makes adding new exchanges straightforward."
>
> "We've adapted these proven patterns to C++20, taking advantage of modern C++ features like move semantics and type safety while keeping the architectural benefits."

---

## Part 2: Order Lifecycle Understanding (1 min)

### Slide: Order Lifecycle Flow

> "To properly implement the connector, we first needed to deeply understand the complete order lifecycle. We broke this down into five distinct phases:"

**Phase 1 - Order Creation**:
> "First, we create the order with a client-generated ID and validate all the parameters."

**Phase 2 - Order Tracking Starts**:
> "Before we even send it to the exchange, we start tracking it locally with a pending state."

**Phase 3 - Order Submission**:
> "Then we submit to the exchange and wait for acknowledgment."

**Phase 4 - Order Updates**:
> "Throughout its lifecycle, we receive updates - whether it's partial fills, full fills, or cancellations."

**Phase 5 - Cleanup**:
> "Finally, when the order is in a terminal state, we clean up and archive the data."

> "This five-phase model ensures we never lose track of an order, even if the network fails or the exchange is slow to respond."

---

## Part 3: Hyperliquid Deep Dive (1.5 min)

### Slide: Hyperliquid Order Execution Deep Dive

> "Since Hyperliquid is our primary target exchange, we did a deep technical dive into their protocol. Hyperliquid is unique in several ways."

**Type: Decentralized CLOB**:
> "It's a decentralized Central Limit Order Book running on a custom Layer 1 blockchain with sub-second block times. This gives us the performance of a centralized exchange with the transparency of DeFi."

**Protocol: WebSocket + REST**:
> "Communication happens over standard WebSocket and REST APIs over HTTPS - nothing exotic here, which is good for reliability."

**Authentication: EIP-712 Signature**:
> "Authentication uses Ethereum's EIP-712 standard for structured data signing. This means we need an Ethereum wallet to sign orders - no API keys like traditional exchanges."

> "This led to several key design patterns we had to implement:"

**Blockchain-Based Authentication**:
> "Every action needs to be cryptographically signed with your Ethereum private key."

**String-Based Precision**:
> "To avoid floating-point errors, Hyperliquid uses string-based decimal precision. For example, Bitcoin needs 5 decimals, Ethereum needs 4. We built converters that handle this precisely."

**Asset Index System**:
> "Instead of ticker symbols, they use numeric asset indexes internally - we handle the mapping transparently."

**Vault/Subaccount Support**:
> "They support trading on behalf of vaults and sub-accounts, which we've architected into our design."

**Client Order ID (cloid)**:
> "They support client-generated order IDs, which is critical for tracking orders through retries and network issues."

---

## Part 4: Implementation Progress (2 min)

### Slide: Phase 1 - Core Architecture Refactoring

> "With that foundation, let me walk you through what we've actually built."
>
> "Phase 1 established our core architecture. We implemented:"

**Abstract connector base class**:
> "An abstract base class with type-safe interfaces that all exchange connectors will inherit from. This gives us compile-time safety and a consistent API."

**Client order ID generation**:
> "A client order ID generator with nanosecond precision - this ensures globally unique IDs even under high-frequency trading loads."

**Price and amount quantization**:
> "Helper functions to quantize prices and amounts according to each exchange's tick size and lot size rules."

**Trading pair validation**:
> "Validation logic to ensure we're using correct symbol formats before sending orders."

**Tests**:
> "And of course, comprehensive unit tests - 12 tests, all passing."

> "Phase 1 is complete and production-ready. About 710 lines of code, zero warnings, all tested."

---

### Slide: Phase 2 - Order State Management

> "Phase 2 built on this with our order state management system."

**Thread-safe order tracking**:
> "We implemented a thread-safe order tracker that can handle concurrent access from multiple threads - market data, order updates, and strategy threads can all safely access order state."

**9-state order lifecycle machine**:
> "A state machine with nine distinct states covering the entire order lifecycle - from pending creation, through various open and partial-fill states, to terminal states like filled, cancelled, or failed."

**Move semantics**:
> "We leveraged C++ move semantics for efficiency - orders are moved, not copied, which eliminates unnecessary allocations."

**Event callbacks**:
> "An event callback system so other components can react to order state changes in real-time."

**Concurrent access tested**:
> "We validated thread safety by testing with 1,000 orders across 10 concurrent threads - no race conditions, no deadlocks."

**Tests**:
> "14 comprehensive tests, all passing. About 875 lines of code."

> "Phase 2 is also complete and production-ready."

---

### Slide: Phase 3 - Data Source Abstractions - ONGOING

> "Phase 3 is our data source abstractions, and this is where we currently are."
>
> "We've implemented the OrderBook structure for managing Level 2 market data - bids and asks sorted by price, with O(1) access to best bid and best ask."
>
> "We've also created abstract interfaces for two types of data sources:"

**OrderBookTrackerDataSource**:
> "This handles public market data - order books, trades, funding rates. No authentication needed."

**UserStreamTrackerDataSource**:
> "This handles private user data - your order updates, fills, balance changes. Requires authentication."

> "The key design decision here was the separation of public and private data. They have independent lifecycles and different reliability requirements."
>
> "We've built mock implementations for testing, and all 16 tests are passing."

> "We're currently at about 825 lines of code for Phase 3. The abstractions are complete, and we're ready to implement the concrete Hyperliquid versions in Phase 5."

---

## Part 5: Status Summary (30 seconds)

> "So to summarize our current status:"
>
> âœ… "We've completed Phases 1 and 2 entirely - that's our core architecture and order tracking."
>
> âœ… "Phase 3 abstractions are complete."
>
> âœ… "Phase 4 - Hyperliquid-specific utilities - is also complete. We have production-ready float-to-wire conversion and the authentication structure in place."
>
> ðŸ”„ "We're now moving into Phase 5, which is the event-driven order lifecycle - this is where we implement the actual Hyperliquid connector and wire everything together."
>
> "In total, we've written about 3,200 lines of code with 58 passing tests and zero warnings. We're about 67% complete with the overall refactoring."

---

## Part 6: Next Steps (30 seconds)

> "Our next steps for Phase 5 are:"
>
> "1. Implement the HyperliquidPerpetualConnector with buy, sell, and cancel operations."
>
> "2. Build the WebSocket data sources for real-time market data and order updates."
>
> "3. Wire up the complete order flow - from placing an order, to tracking it, to receiving fills."
>
> "4. Validate everything on Hyperliquid's testnet."
>
> "We estimate Phase 5 will take 1-2 weeks, adding about 2,500 lines of code."

## Closing (15 seconds)

> "That's where we are. We're on track, we have no blockers, and the foundation is solid. All our tests are passing, the code quality is high, and we're ready to deliver a production-ready trading connector."
>
> "Happy to take any questions."

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why Hummingbot's architecture?**
> **A**: "Hummingbot has proven this architecture works at scale across 30+ exchanges. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we're adapting battle-tested patterns to C++ for better performance."

---

**Q: What about the crypto signing for Hyperliquid?**
> **A**: "Great question. We've implemented the EIP-712 signing structure, but for production we're planning to use an external signer - either Python or TypeScript - via IPC. This lets us leverage existing, audited crypto libraries rather than implementing secp256k1 signing from scratch in C++."

---

**Q: How thread-safe is this?**
> **A**: "Very thread-safe. The order tracker uses read-write locks, allowing multiple readers but exclusive writers. We've tested with 1,000 orders across 10 threads with no race conditions. Each data source also runs in its own thread with async message passing."

---

**Q: Can we add other exchanges?**
> **A**: "Absolutely. That's the whole point of the abstraction layer. Once Hyperliquid is complete, adding Binance, Bybit, or any other exchange is a matter of implementing the same interfaces. The architecture is exchange-agnostic."

---

**Q: Performance impact?**
> **A**: "Most components are header-only with move semantics, so there's minimal overhead. We're getting compiler optimizations and link-time optimization. OrderBook operations are O(1) for best bid/ask, O(log n) for updates. Thread synchronization uses read-write locks to minimize contention."

---

**Q: Timeline to production?**
> **A**: "Phase 5 is 1-2 weeks, Phase 6 integration is about 1 week. So we're looking at 2-3 weeks to have a fully operational Hyperliquid connector running on testnet, then we'll do production validation."

---

**Q: Test coverage?**
> **A**: "Currently at 85%+ test coverage. Every major component has comprehensive unit tests. We're also planning integration tests in Phase 6 that will test the complete order flow end-to-end."

---

**Q: What about the Python code?**
> **A**: "The Python trading core will remain operational during the refactoring. This is a parallel implementation, not a rewrite-in-place. We'll gradually migrate strategies over once the C++ connector is validated in production."

---

**Q: Dependencies?**
> **A**: "We're using vcpkg for package management. Current dependencies are nlohmann-json for JSON parsing, Google Test for testing, and spdlog for logging. For Phase 5 we'll add boost-beast for WebSocket and boost-asio for async I/O. All are well-maintained, header-only or header-mostly libraries."

---

**Q: Why did you defer dYdX v4?**
> **A**: "dYdX v4 uses the Cosmos SDK which adds significant complexity - different signing scheme, different message format, different transaction model. We wanted to validate the architecture with Hyperliquid first, then add dYdX if there's demand. It's a scope management decision to ship faster."

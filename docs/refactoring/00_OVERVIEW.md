# Refactoring Plan: Hummingbot Architecture for C++ Trading Engine

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan to align the latentspeed C++ trading engine with Hummingbot's proven architecture patterns. The refactoring is designed to be **incremental** with **minimal disruption** to existing functionality.

## Project Structure

This refactoring plan is split across multiple documents:

- **[00_OVERVIEW.md](00_OVERVIEW.md)** - This document (executive summary)
- **[01_CURRENT_STATE.md](01_CURRENT_STATE.md)** - Analysis of current implementation
- **[02_PHASE1_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md](02_PHASE1_CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Connector base classes
- **[03_PHASE2_ORDER_TRACKING.md](03_PHASE2_ORDER_TRACKING.md)** - Order state management
- **[04_PHASE3_DATA_SOURCES.md](04_PHASE3_DATA_SOURCES.md)** - OrderBook & UserStream trackers
- **[05_PHASE4_AUTH_MODULES.md](05_PHASE4_AUTH_MODULES.md)** - Exchange-specific authentication
- **[06_PHASE5_EVENT_LIFECYCLE.md](06_PHASE5_EVENT_LIFECYCLE.md)** - Event-driven order lifecycle
- **[07_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md](07_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)** - Step-by-step migration plan
- **[08_FILE_STRUCTURE.md](08_FILE_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete file/directory layout

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Week 1 | Core connector base classes |
| Phase 2 | Week 2 | Order tracking infrastructure |
| Phase 3 | Week 2 | Data source abstractions |
| Phase 4 | Week 3 | Exchange-specific auth modules |
| Phase 5 | Week 4 | Event-driven lifecycle |
| Phase 6 | Week 5-6 | Integration & testing |

## Key Benefits

1. **Proven Architecture**: Battle-tested Hummingbot patterns used in production
2. **Better State Management**: InFlightOrder state machine prevents race conditions
3. **Event-Driven**: Async order updates via WebSocket user streams
4. **Exchange Isolation**: Clean separation between connector logic and data sources
5. **Type Safety**: Strongly typed order states, events, updates
6. **Testability**: Each component is independently testable
7. **Scalability**: Easy to add new exchanges following same pattern

## Critical Design Principles

### From Hummingbot Analysis

1. **Start Tracking Before API Call**: Prevents lost order updates
2. **Client Order ID as Primary Key**: Exchange order ID comes later
3. **Async Order Placement**: Non-blocking return, async submission
4. **Event-Driven Updates**: WebSocket user streams for real-time state
5. **Separate Data Sources**: OrderBook and UserStream are independent
6. **Exchange-Specific Auth**: Each exchange has dedicated auth module

### C++ Specific Optimizations

1. **Zero-Copy Where Possible**: Use `std::string_view` and spans
2. **Move Semantics**: Leverage C++20 move semantics for large objects
3. **Coroutines**: Use C++20 coroutines for async operations
4. **Lock-Free**: Maintain existing lock-free data structures
5. **Memory Pools**: Keep pre-allocated memory pools for hot path

## Quick Reference: Hummingbot Components â†’ C++ Equivalents

| Hummingbot | Current C++ | Refactored C++ |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `ConnectorBase.pyx` | `IExchangeAdapter` | `ConnectorBase` |
| `Exchange/Derivative.py` | Various adapters | `PerpetualDerivativeBase` |
| `InFlightOrder` | Order structs | `InFlightOrder` class |
| `ClientOrderTracker` | Direct maps | `ClientOrderTracker` |
| `OrderBookTracker` | `MarketDataProvider` | `OrderBookTracker` + `DataSource` |
| `UserStreamTracker` | WebSocket callbacks | `UserStreamTracker` + `DataSource` |
| `*_auth.py` | Auth in adapters | Dedicated `*Auth` classes |
| `*_web_utils.py` | Utility functions | `*WebUtils` namespaces |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Order placement latency < 500Î¼s (excluding network)
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in 24-hour stress test
- [ ] 100% test coverage for order state machine
- [ ] Support for Hyperliquid and dYdX v4
- [ ] Backward compatible API via adapter facades
- [ ] Clean separation of concerns
- [ ] Production-ready logging and metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this overview and all phase documents
2. **Validate** the approach with team/stakeholders
3. **Start Phase 1**: Core connector base architecture
4. **Iterate** with feedback after each phase
